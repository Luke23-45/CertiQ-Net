"""Persistent checkpoint state manifest for cross-process model loading.

After training completes, ``save_checkpoint_state`` writes a small JSON
manifest to the experiment run directory plus an experiment-level
``.last_run.json`` that points to the latest trained run.  Downstream
evaluation functions use ``require_checkpoint_state`` to discover the
checkpoint path, or exit with a clear error if no trained checkpoint exists.

Paths are stored **relative** to the run root so manifests are portable
across machines (cloud → local, different mount points, etc.).
